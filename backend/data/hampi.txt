Set amid dramatic boulder strewn hills and the calm flow of the Tungabhadra River, Hampi is one of Karnataka’s most extraordinary heritage destinations. Once the capital of the powerful Vijayanagara Empire, Hampi today stands as a vast open air museum, where history unfolds across temples, royal enclosures, marketplaces, and riverbanks.
Recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site , Hampi offers an experience unlike any other. Every path leads past centuries old structures, sculpted stone, and architectural brilliance that speak of prosperity, devotion, and artistic excellence. Exploring Hampi is not just sightseeing; it is a journey through one of the greatest chapters of Karnataka’s past.
The Vijayanagara Heritage Circuit (Architecture & History)
Hampi spreads across a large landscape, with monuments grouped into distinct zones that reflect religious, royal, and civic life.
One of the oldest functioning temples in India, this sacred site continues daily worship and forms the spiritual heart of Hampi. Its towering gopuram dominates the skyline.
The temple’s origins trace to the 7th century, when Hampi was known as Pampa Kshetra, a pilgrimage center on the banks of the Tungabhadra River. It flourished under the Vijayanagara Empire (14th–16th centuries CE), when rulers like Krishnadevaraya enlarged and richly endowed it. Despite invasions that led to the city’s decline, the temple remained continuously active, preserving its religious traditions.
Famous for the iconic stone chariot and the musical pillared hall, this complex represents the peak of Vijayanagara craftsmanship.
Once a thriving commercial street, the long stone paved bazaar offers insight into the city’s urban planning and trade life. Hampi Bazaar flourished as a grand marketplace where merchants from across Asia traded in precious stones, textiles, spices, and horses.
