Magadi is the birthplace of Kempegowda , the visionary founder of Bengaluru. Tucked in the countryside west of the city, Magadi was once the capital of a small principality and played a pivotal role in Karnataka’s 16th-century history. Today, it quietly houses temples, forts, and ruins that whisper stories of ambition, strategy, and resilience.
The Ranganathaswamy Temple stands as Magadi’s architectural highlight, with its striking Dravidian style and royal patronage evident in every stone. The surrounding hills and countryside add a scenic charm, making Magadi not only a historical landmark but also a rural escape for heritage lovers.
