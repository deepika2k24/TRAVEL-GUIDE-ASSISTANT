Bengaluru Rural covers Devanahalli, Doddaballapur, Hoskote, and Nelamangala, offering quick day trips to heritage forts, hill-temples, lakes, and easy treks just beyond the city limits. With the airport at Devanahalli as a convenient anchor, it’s simple to combine Devanahalli Fort, Ghati Subramanya, and the Makalidurga hill trail in one circuit.
Devanahalli Fort dates to the early 16th century and the area is associated with the birth of Tipu Sultan.
Ghati Subramanya is famed for its unique twin idol of Subramanya and Narasimha, drawing large festival crowds.
The Makalidurga trek begins near a railway halt and climbs to fort ruins and a hilltop Shiva shrine with lake views.
Avati Betta hosts a centuries-old Thimmaraya Swamy hill-temple with a scenic stepped approach.
Devanahalli Fort and Tipu Birthplace zone: Arched gateways, bastions, and in-fort shrines.
Ghati Subramanya Temple (Doddaballapur): Major pilgrimage center and seasonal fairs.
Makalidurga Fort Trek: Moderate granite-hill climb to a shrine and panoramic summit.
Avati Betta (Sri Lakshmi Thimmaraya Swamy Temple): Family-friendly hill steps and sunrise views.
Avathi Lake viewpoint: Quiet lakeside stop paired with Avati Betta.
Kundana Betta: Modest hill-fort remains and countryside panoramas.
Chikka Madhure Shani Mahatma Temple (Nelamangala): Popular Saturday darshan and annadana.
Trace fort walls, gateways, and shrines at Devanahalli for a compact heritage walk.
Plan festival-time darshan at Ghati Subramanya and Chikka Madhure for immersive rituals.
Book Makalidurga trek slots, target sunrise or late afternoon, and carry water and sun protection.
Add Avati Betta steps and Kundana Betta strolls for easy hill time with minimal driving.
The district’s hub, Devanahalli, is about 35 km north of central Bengaluru via NH 44; Doddaballapur and Nelamangala are linked by good highways and state roads. Kempegowda International Airport (BLR) sits at Devanahalli, ideal for quick in-and-out day circuits. Makalidurga railway halt (MKL) on the Bengaluru–Guntakal line serves the trek base, with local trains and road access.

Trek protocol: Use the official slot system for Makalidurga, stick to marked trails, and avoid walking on rail lines.
Temple etiquette: Dress modestly; Saturdays and festival days can be crowded. So try to reach early.
Weather: Start early in summer; monsoon brings slippery rocks on hill paths.
Transport: Last-mile autos/taxis are readily available around Devanahalli and Doddaballapur.
Bengaluru Rural delivers an easy blend of heritage and outdoors like the Devanahalli’s fort, Ghati Subramanya’s living traditions, and Makalidurga’s views. This is perfect for a tightly planned day just outside the city.
