The Highlands of Coffee, Clouds, and Calm
Cradled in the Western Ghats of Karnataka, Chikkamagaluru is a district where mist drapes mountain slopes and coffee estates stretch across rolling terrain. Known as the birthplace of coffee cultivation in the state, Chikkamagaluru blends high altitude landscapes with deep rooted traditions and a pace of life shaped by nature.
The district offers a refreshing contrast of dramatic peaks, forested valleys, waterfalls, and quiet plantation towns. Whether it is the pull of mountain trails, the aroma of coffee beans drying in the sun, or the spiritual stillness of sacred hills, Chikkamagaluru invites travellers to experience Karnataka’s highlands at their most restorative.
The Highland Heritage Circuit (Nature & History)
Chikkamagaluru’s landmarks are shaped as much by geography as by history and belief.
The highest peak in Karnataka, Mullayanagiri offers sweeping views of the surrounding ranges. The climb is rewarding, with cool winds, cloud cover, and panoramic landscapes defining the experience.
A range of hills revered for both spiritual and historical significance, Baba Budangiri is closely associated with the early history of coffee cultivation in the region. The area is known for its caves, viewpoints, and serene atmosphere.
Characterised by rolling green hills and grasslands, this range forms part of the district’s striking natural backdrop and supports rich biodiversity.
Chikkamagaluru is defined by its forests, waterfalls, and plantation landscapes.
Hebbe Falls Tucked within dense forest, this multi tiered waterfall is most impressive after the monsoon, when water cascades through rocky slopes surrounded by greenery.
Kalhatti Falls A scenic waterfall near Baba Budangiri, where water flows over rock faces close to a small temple, blending nature with local belief.
Coffee Estate Walks Guided walks through plantations offer insight into coffee cultivation, processing, and estate life, along with opportunities to spot birds and native flora.
