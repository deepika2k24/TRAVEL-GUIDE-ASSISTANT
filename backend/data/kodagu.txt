Kodagu’s charm lies in its balance. Mornings begin with mist drifting over plantations, days unfold amid waterfalls and forest trails, and evenings settle into calm hilltown rhythms. Deeply shaped by the Kodava community and their traditions, the district offers travellers a chance to experience Karnataka’s hills at their most authentic and unhurried.
