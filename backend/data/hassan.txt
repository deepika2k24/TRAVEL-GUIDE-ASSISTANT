Surrounded by Dakshina Kannada in the west, Chikkamagaluru and Chitradurga in the north, Coorg towards the south and Tumkuru in the east, Hassan has an eventful and rich history. It is blessed with a pleasant climate and a great picturesque location. It is here where the plains (maidaans) begin to gently slope into the Western Ghats (malnad). Although not a proper hill station, Hassan is often referred to as “Poor Man’s Ooty”.
Hassan is also associated with the Hoysala Empire who had their capital at Belur and Dwarasamudra (present-day Halebeedu). The district is a veritable treasure-house of Hoysala architecture and sculpture, the best specimens of which are at Belur and Halebeedu. However, there are many more yet lesser-known architectural gems in various parts of the district. Many other touristic treasures also await you here like Hasanamba Temple and the Saptamatrikas, the drowning church at Shettyhalli, Mosale temples, a star-shaped fort at Manjarabad and Bisele Ghat.

When to go: All year-round. The Hoysala Festival is held in January
